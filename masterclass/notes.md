The aim of the proposed research <- *Not a good way to start*

*Exercise*
Outline the context and rationale for your proposal in 4 sentences.

- The standard scientific method does not work in mathematics.

- The process of doing mathematical research usually starts with an idea that eventually becomes a hypothesis based on merely intuition and sometimes a handful of examples.

- Process analogous to observation,  measurement, and data collection are usually overseen, often due to the nature of the objects.

- Discrete and combinatorial objects admit natural computational but often inefficient. Creating useful and accessible datasets of such objects allows us to improve the way research is carried.

## Objectives

an overall project result - what your research will produce
why you and the specified supervisor.

derivables:
Not about knowledge but actual derivables (tangible products)

'to achieve this the project will bring together a research with expertise in XYZ with a supervisor with expertise in ABC'

*Exercise*: Write an overall objective including an statement of the main derivable and a concise explanation of 'why this fellow and supervisor'

Overarching goal for our proposal: Build comprehensive, accessible useful
and reliable datasets of abstract polytopes, maniplexes and related objects. To achieve this goal, the project will bring together a research with expertise on theoretical constructions of such objects and supervisor who is a leading expert on building datasets of of graphs and other discrete objects.

1.1.3 The extend to which the project goes beyond the art
Common mistake: treat this section as literature review

- What is known
- What is not knowledge
- Why is important to fill the knowledge gap and how your research will do this.

Check that every paragraph is connected to your research project.

- This section should:
- Build upon the justification for your research such the reviewer understan the need for the research objectives.
- Demonstrate your knowledge of relevan research (including that different disciplines/sectors)
- Position both researcher and supervisor within the SOA
- Demonstrate and explain how your research will go beyond what is known.
- Demonstrate ambition (but no to much)

## 1.2.4. Open science practices

Describe how appropriate open science practices are implemented as an integral part of the proposed methodology. Show how the choice of practices and their implementations is adapted to the nature of your work in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering of its objectives

- Open cooperative work and systematic sharing of knowledge and tools, as early and widely as possible in the reseach process.

- Enables greater collaboration with other researches and let ordinary citizens engage in science

*Stating that publication will be made open access is not sufficient*

- Produced results must be shared, made reusable and be reproducable
- Open science principles, "as open as possible, as closed as necessary"

*publications need to be open*
