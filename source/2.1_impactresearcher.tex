\label{sec:impactresearcher}

The candidate's long-term goal is to obtain a permanent academic position.
The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will train the candidate in two main sets of skills.
On the one hand, with the guidance of the supervisor, the candidate will consolidate his young career as a theoretical mathematician working with highly symmetric objects. In particular, the candidate will gain training on \emph{permutation groups} and \emph{symmetries of graphs}. This will increase the candidate's presence on the community, and hence improve his chances to obtain a permanent academic job.
On the other hand, the computational skills needed to build the proposed datasets will make the candidate a desirable researcher not only for pure math departments but also for computer science departments.

Moreover, the time that the candidate will spend in the \emph{Faculty of Mathematics and Physics} of the University of Ljubljana will give the candidate opportunities to increase his teaching experience.

Finally, the programming and data management training obtained as a result of the proposed research will not only improve the candidate's chances to get not only an academic position but also a non academic job.
