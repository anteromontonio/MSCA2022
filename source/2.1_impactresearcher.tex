% The candidate's long-term goal is to obtain a permanent academic position.
The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will provide me with training in two mains sets of skills.
On the one hand, with the guidance of the supervisor, I will consolidate my young career as a theoretical mathematician working with highly symmetric objects.
In particular, I shall gain training on \emph{permutation groups} and \emph{symmetries of graphs}.
The strong presence of prof. Potoƒçnik will increase my own presence in the community which in turn will improve my chances to obtain a permanent academic job.

On the other hand, the computational skills needed to build the proposed datasets, such as the development of software packages, databases, and the mathematical knowledge management will make me a desirable researcher not only for pure math departments but also for computer-science-oriented institutions.

Moreover, FMF-UL host an undergraduate and graduate program in mathematics which is a great opportunity for me to increase my teaching experience.

Finally, the programming and data management training obtained as a result of the proposed research will not only improve my chances to get an academic position but also a non academic job as a software developer, data manager or any other data-oriented position.
