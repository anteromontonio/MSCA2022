  abstract     = {The paper investigates connections between abstract polytopes and properly edge colored graphs. Given any finite n-edge-colored n-regular graph G, we associate to G a simple abstract polytope PGof rank n, the colorful polytope of G, with 1-skeleton isomorphic to G. We investigate the interplay between the geometric, combinatorial, or algebraic properties of the polytope PGand the combinatorial or algebraic structure of the underlying graph G, focussing in particular on aspects of symmetry. Several such families of colorful polytopes are studied including examples derived from a Cayley graph, in particular the graphicahedra, as well as the flagadjacency polytopes and related monodromy polytopes associated with a given abstract polytope. The duals of certain families of colorful polytopes have been important in the topological study of colored triangulations and crystallization of manifolds.},

  abstract  = {“Polyhedron” means different things to different people. There is very little in common between the meaning of the word in topology and in geometry. But even if we confine attention to geometry of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space-as we shall do from now on -“polyhedron” can mean either a solid (as in “Platonic solids”, convex polyhedron, and other contexts), or a surface (such as the polyhedral models constructed from cardboard using “nets”, which were introduced by Albrecht Dürer [[17]] in 1525, or, in a more modern version, by Aleksandrov [[1]]), or the 1-dimensional complex consisting of points (“vertices”) and line-segments (“edges”) organized in a suitable way into polygons (“faces”) subject to certain restrictions (“skeletal polyhedra”, diagrams of which have been presented first by Luca Pacioli [[44]] in 1498 and attributed to Leonardo da Vinci). The last alternative is the least usual one-but it is close to what seems to be the most useful approach to the theory of general polyhedra. Indeed, it does not restrict faces to be planar, and it makes possible to retrieve the other characterizations in circumstances in which they reasonably apply: If the faces of a “surface” polyhedron are simple polygons, in most cases the polyhedron is unambiguously determined by the boundary circuits of the faces. And if the polyhedron itself is without selfintersections, then the “solid” can be found from the faces. These reasons, as well as some others, seem to warrant the choice of our approach.},

This is a natural question for anyone studying group theory, and this Tract provides an exhaustive and up-to-date account of research into this question spanning almost fifty years. The authors presuppose an undergraduate knowledge of group theory, up to and including Sylow's Theorems, a little knowledge of how a group may be presented by generators and relations, a very little representation theory from the perspective of module theory, and a very little cohomology theory - but most of the basics are expounded here and the book is more or less self-contained. Although it is principally devoted to a connected exposition of an agreeable theory, the book does also contain some material that has not hitherto been published. It is designed to be used as a graduate text but also as a handbook for established research workers in group theory.},

  abstract    = {An abstract polytope is a combinatorial object that generalises geometric structures such as convex polytopes, tilings, maps on surfaces, among others. All such structures present an inductive nature: a polygon can be regarded as a family of line segments glued along their endpoints; a polyhedron can be understood as a family of polygons glued along their edges; a tiling of the space can be thought as a family of polyhedra glued along their faces, an so on. This inductive nature is still present in the abstract notion of a polytope and rises the \emph{extension problem}. Given an abstract polytope $\cK$, does there exist an abstract polytope $\cP$ such that all the maximal facets of $\cP$ are isomorphic to $\cK$? In this work we explore the problem when strong symmetry conditions are imposed to $\cP$. In particular, we show some original construction of chiral extensions in the situation when $\cK$ is a tilling with cubes of the $n$-dimensional torus.},

Toroids are generalisations of maps on the torus to higher dimensions and also provide examples of abstract polytopes. Equivelar toroids are those that are induced by regular tessellations. In this paper we present a classification of equivelar \$\$(n+1)\$\$(n+1)-toroids with at most n flag-orbits; in particular, we discuss a classification of 2-orbit toroids of arbitrary dimension.},

We find that while the mathematical community embraces the notion of open data, the FAIR principles are not yet sufficiently realized. Indeed, we claim that the case of mathematical data is special, since the objects of interest are abstract (all properties can be known) and complex (they have a rich inner structure that must be represented). We present a novel classification of mathematical data and derive an extended set of FAIR requirements, which accomodate the special needs of math datasets. We summarize these as deep FAIR . Finally, we show a prototypical system infrastructure, which can realize deep FAIRness for one category (tabular data) of mathematical datasets.},
